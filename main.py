# The master app doesn't need the lifespan context since qc_app handles it.
master_app = FastAPI(

# 1. CORS Middleware (Applied to the master app)
origins = [
    "http://localhost:3000",                 
    "https://pm-aqt9.vercel.app",             
    # You can also add the pattern for all vercel subdomains if your deployment URL changes often:
    # "https://*.vercel.app",

# --- ROUTING/MOUNTING ---
    
# 1. Mount the QC API as a sub-application (Example path: /qc/api/run_qc)
# If you prefer the old path structure, you might need to adjust prefixes in qc_api.py
# master_app.mount("/qc", qc_app) # Option 1: Mount with a prefix
master_app.include_router(qc_router, prefix="/api/qc", tags=["QC Automation"])

# 2. Include the Dashboard Router (Example path: /api/dashboard/projects)
master_app.include_router(dashboard_router , prefix="/api" )
